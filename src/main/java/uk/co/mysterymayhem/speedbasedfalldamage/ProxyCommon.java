     * Here be maths. I don't really remember how it was all calculated and I'm pretty sure some of these comments are
     * wrong, seeing as they don't come to the same answers as what the code is actually using...
     * <p>
     * This is based on two recurrence relations.<br>
     * &emsp;motionY at ticks 0:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;motY(0) = 0<br>
     * &emsp;motionY at ticks t+1:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;motY(t+1) = 0.98 * (motY(t) - 0.08)<br>
     * &emsp;motY(t) = (((49 / 50) ^ t) - 1) * 98 / 25<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;just put "f(t+1) = 0.98 * (f(t) - 0.08), f(0) = 0" into wolfram alpha<br>
     * <p>
     * &emsp;distance at ticks 0:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(0) = 0<br>
     * &emsp;distance at ticks 1:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(1) = motY(0)<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;during each tick, player first moves by motionY, motionY is then changed near the end of the tick<br>
     * &emsp;distance at ticks 2:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(2) = d(1) + motY(1)<br>
     * &emsp;distance at ticks n+1:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(t+1) = d(t) + motY(t)<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(t+1) = d(t) + (((49 / 50) ^ t) - 1) * 98 / 25<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(t) = -98 / 25 * (50 * ((49 / 50) ^ t - 1) + t)<br>
     * However, I wrote it down as d(t) = -98 / 25 * (50 * ((49 / 50) ^ (t + 1) - 1) + t + 1).<br>
     * &emsp;Maybe something to do with the fact that network ticks occur after update ticks<br>
     * So we now have distance as a function of ticks, but what we need is distance as a function of motionY<br>
     * <p>
     * Ticks as a function of motionY is t(y) = ln(1 + 25 * y / 98) / ln(49 / 50) based on our earlier formula<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(t(y)) = -98 / 25 * (50 * ((49 / 50) ^ t(y) - 1) + t(y))<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(y) = -98 / 25 * (50 * ((49 / 50) ^ (ln(1 + 25 * y / 98) / ln(49 / 50)) - 1) + (ln(1 + 25 * y / 98) / ln(49 / 50)))<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(y) = 196 − 98 * (50 * (25 * y / 98 + 1) − ((ln(25 * y / 98 + 1)) / (ln(50 / 49)))) / 25<br>
     * &emsp;Rearranging:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(y) = 196 − 98 * (50 * (25 / 98 * y + 1) − ((ln(25 / 98 * y + 1)) / (ln(50 / 49)))) / 25<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;part1 = 25 / 98 * y + 1<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(y) = 196 − 98 * (50 * part1 − ((ln(part1)) / (ln(50 / 49)))) / 25<br>
     * &emsp;Rearranging:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(y) = 196 − 98 / 25 * (50 * part1 − ((ln(part1)) / (ln(50 / 49))))<br>
     * &emsp;Cached calculations:<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;b = 98 / 25<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;c = ln(50 / 49)<br>
     * &emsp;&emsp;d(y) = 196 − b * (50 * part1 − ((ln(part1)) / c))<br>
     * &emsp;I don't know how I got to the final result from here, I think there was some trial and error because it<br>
